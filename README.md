# LEMPZY: LEMP and Bash for lazy people
Created and Developed by a Lazy Sysadmin: X@rbonfil / info@rbonfil.me

This is a repository where I store some scripts for managing LEMP servers, based on Ubuntu 20.04, 22.04, 24.04, or Debian 10, 11, and 12.

You wonâ€™t find anything professional or important here. But some scripts might be useful for your work as a sysadmin.

These scripts are for lazy people. I recommend avoiding them because they create a bad habit, like coffee or stronger drugs, such as chocolate.


# Available scripts

check_service.sh 
- Check active services in Linux and restart them if necessary

cloduflare_ddns.sh
- Bash Script for Cloudflare DDNS (IPv4 & IPv6) with cURL Integration. This Bash script leverages the Cloudflare API to dynamically update DNS records (A and AAAA) for both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. Designed for seamless integration with cURL, it ensures real-time updates with a TTL of 60 seconds, providing a reliable solution for maintaining up-to-date DNS entries.
