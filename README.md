# LEMPZY: LEMP and Bash for lazy people
Created and Developed by a Lazy Sysadmin
X@rbonfil / info@rbonfil.me

This is a repository where I store some scripts for managing LEMP servers, based on Ubuntu 20.04, 22.04, 24.04, or Debian 10, 11, and 12.

You wonâ€™t find anything professional or important here. But some scripts might be useful for your work as a sysadmin.

These scripts are for lazy people. I recommend avoiding them because they create a bad habit, like coffee or stronger drugs, such as chocolate.
